## Real vs Fake
Rumors. Gossip. Fake news.
We've all heard these terms, messaging app like Facebook and Whatsapp has become a major channel for hate speech and false stories in India. The government is demanding changes.
A simple way to identify the fake images by appling CNN on more than 10M fake and original images using tenserflow.
Our project aims to detect if any changes are made in the images after it was clicked.
### How it works:
We are using the dataset "Real and Fake Face Detection" which contains real/fake face photos, respectively.
*We have implemented our project in python with the help of following libraries:*
1. opencv2
2. matplotlib
3. keras
4. numpy
5. pandas
